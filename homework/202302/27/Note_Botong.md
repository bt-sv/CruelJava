LET'S START WITH JVM

The JVM, or Java Virtual Machine, is an essential component of the Java platform. It is a software implementation of a computer that executes Java bytecode. Here are some essential aspects of the JVM:

Platform independence: The JVM allows Java programs to run on any platform that has a JVM installed. This is because the JVM executes bytecode, which is platform-independent.

Memory management: The JVM manages memory allocation and deallocation for Java programs. It performs garbage collection, which frees up memory that is no longer being used by the program.

Security: The JVM provides a security sandbox to prevent untrusted code from accessing system resources. It also verifies bytecode before executing it to ensure that it does not violate security constraints.

Just-in-time compilation: The JVM uses a technique called just-in-time (JIT) compilation to improve the performance of Java programs. The JVM dynamically compiles bytecode into native machine code at runtime, which can result in significant performance improvements.

Class loading: The JVM loads Java classes into memory as they are needed by the program. It also provides mechanisms for dynamically loading classes at runtime.

Overall, the JVM plays a crucial role in the Java platform, providing a layer of abstraction between the Java code and the underlying hardware and operating system.

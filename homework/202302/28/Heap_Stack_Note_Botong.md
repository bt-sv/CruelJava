In the context of programming languages, particularly in memory management, the terms "heap" and "stack" refer to different regions of memory with different properties. Here are some key differences between the heap and the stack:

Allocation and deallocation: Memory on the stack is allocated and deallocated automatically as local variables and function calls come and go. Memory on the heap, on the other hand, is allocated dynamically at runtime and must be explicitly deallocated when no longer needed.

Data structure: The stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure that is used to store temporary data such as local variables, function calls, and program execution context. The heap, on the other hand, is a region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation, where objects and data structures are allocated.

Access: Memory on the stack can only be accessed by the currently executing thread, whereas memory on the heap can be accessed by any thread with a reference to the memory location.

Size: The stack is typically smaller than the heap and has a fixed size, determined at compile time. The heap, on the other hand, can grow and shrink dynamically as needed.

Fragmentation: Memory on the heap can become fragmented over time as objects are allocated and deallocated. This can result in performance issues and the need for garbage collection. The stack does not suffer from fragmentation, as memory is allocated and deallocated in a strict LIFO order.
